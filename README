Amstrad CPC (6128) emulator, written in Python.

This is not complete. Many instructions are not implemented. There is no keyboard or disc drive handling. It was written as a test / proof-of-concept to see if an emulator could be written in Python and be performant enough, and to use data types like ByteArray and the pygame library.

The answer was 'not quite'. All the bit twiddling is quite expensive.

You will need two ROM images:

   6128L.rom
   6128U-basic.rom

You can get these from http://www.cpcwiki.eu/index.php/ROM_List
   First is the Lower ROM for "CPC 6128 OS English"
   Second is the BASIC ROM for "CPC 6128 Basic English"
