Amstrad CPC (6128) emulator, written in Python.

This is not complete. Many instructions are not implemented. There is no keyboard or disc drive handling. It was written as a test / proof-of-concept to see if an emulator could be written in Python and be performant enough, and to use data types like ByteArray and the pygame library.

The answer was 'not quite'. All the bit twiddling is quite expensive.
